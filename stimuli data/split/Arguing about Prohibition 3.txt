Author Daniel Okrent offers an alternative view of Prohibition. Okrent says that an “unlikely coalition,” which included anti-immigration activists and advocates of implementing an income tax, was responsible. At a time when millions of immigrants were flooding into the country, native-born, white Protestant Americans saw their political power diminishing and sought to weaken the political clout of saloon owners, who had enormous influence over immigrant voters. Fueled by anti-German propaganda during World War I, they also saw breweries, which were largely German-owned, as a menace to society. Prohibition became a stand-in issue that could be used to stem the rising tide of immigrants’ political influence. Similarly, income-tax advocates seized on Prohibition as a means for depriving the government of a crucial revenue source. About half the federal government’s revenue came from an excise tax on alcohol, and Prohibition would make the implementation of the first US income tax a necessity. Okrent argues that though many people who voted for Prohibition were drinkers themselves, they voted for it as a means to an end that was not what it appeared to be on the surface.
