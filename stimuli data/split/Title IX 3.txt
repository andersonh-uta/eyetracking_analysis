Some male athletes complain that Title IX has robbed them of opportunities, however. While schools have been forced to provide more support to female athletes, their overall budgets often have not expanded enough to accommodate the increase. At the college level in particular, funding for less popular men’s sports such as wrestling has been cut to make more money available for women’s sports teams.

Supporters of Title IX argue that overall, though, the law has had enormous benefits that extend far beyond the positive health effects of playing sports. Researcher Betsey Stevenson performed an analysis comparing states with varying degrees of female athletic participation. She found that in states where females had more chances to participate in sports, women’s education levels and likelihood of finding employment were also higher. In fact, Stevenson’s research indicates that Title IX was responsible for about 40 percent of the increase in employment among women aged 25-34 from 1980 to 2000. If true, this means the law has contributed significantly to helping women achieve equality with men.
