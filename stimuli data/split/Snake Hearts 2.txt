After further experiments, Leinwand removed the chemicals from the snake’s blood and gave them to living mice. As a result, the mice’s hearts grew dramatically. Leinwand believes that her research may be able to help humans with heart diseases. Human hearts grow larger in two ways, one unhealthy and one healthy. When people have high blood pressure, for example, the muscles in their hearts grow to help the heart push blood around the body. This kind of growth actually damages the heart and makes it weaker. On the other hand, when people do exercise, their hearts grow larger in a healthy way.
