Finland, a country in northern Europe, has been ranked as having the highest quality of life in the world. In particular, Finland has been attracting attention for the success of its schools. Since 2000, the country often appears near the top of an international survey of educational standards called PISA. This survey measures the academic level of 15-year-olds around the world in science, math, and reading once every three years.

What surprises many people about Finland’s success is that the country is so different from the others that come at the top of the survey. Those countries’ schools generally emphasize competition between students and between schools, and they often have long hours of study, much homework, and frequent tests. The success of this educational style has led to more countries introducing such competition into their own education systems. Finland, however, has taken a different approach to education.
