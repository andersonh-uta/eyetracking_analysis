Aboriginal people believe that songlines tell the story of the beginning of the world. They believe that before people lived on the earth, there were gods that lived here. The mountains, rivers, and valleys were created by these gods. For example, the Rainbow Serpent song tells the story of a snake god who created rivers and mountains while traveling around northern Australia. Aboriginal people sang this song and followed the same path.
