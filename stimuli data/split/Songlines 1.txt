Nowadays, when people are traveling long distances, they usually follow maps and signs to get to where they are going. Thousands of years ago in Australia, however, there were no maps or signs, but people still traveled long distances without getting lost. Aboriginal people had a special way to help them travel. They used songs to describe the mountains, rivers, and rocks that people would see while they were traveling. By following the directions in these songs, called songlines, people could travel without getting lost.
