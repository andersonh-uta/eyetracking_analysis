Psychologists have found evidence, however, that it is probably not living in cities that makes people less likely to help others. In fact, the bystander effect can be found in almost any environment. In an experiment conducted in 1968, psychologists John Darley and Bibb Latané put research participants in a room, sometimes alone and sometimes with others. They then introduced smoke into the room to indicate the presence of a fire. When the subjects were alone, 75 percent reported the possible fire. When two other people, pretending to also be participants, joined the subjects in the room and acted as if they did not notice the smoke, only 10 percent of the participants reported it. Darley and Latané concluded that when people observe that others around them are not responding to an event, they are much less likely to react themselves.
