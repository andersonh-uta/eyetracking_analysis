There are songlines that describe almost every part of Australia, and they are sung in many different Aboriginal languages. However, even if people do not understand the language in the song, they can follow its directions. This is because both the words and the music help people to imagine what the land looks like. For example, a high sound means that something tall like a mountain is being described.

Songlines were an important part of Aboriginal culture for thousands of years, but this began to change when the British arrived in Australia in 1788. Aboriginal children had to go to British schools instead of spending time in nature and learning songlines from their families. Slowly, people began to forget the songlines. However, these days, the Australian government is working hard to save the songlines.
