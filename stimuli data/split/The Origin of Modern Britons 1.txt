For generations, students of British history have been taught that the Celts, a warlike yet culturally advanced ethnic group, were Britain’s indigenous people, having migrated from central Europe to populate present-day England and the rest of the British Isles during the Iron Age, around 400 BC. The Celts were subsequently overrun by a series of invaders in the fourth and fifth centuries AD, most notably the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes -- Germanic tribes from whom the modern population of England is said to be descended. According to traditional accounts, Celtic inhabitants remained in areas such as Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, but were wiped out by the Anglo-Saxons in England, and the Celts’ lyrical language, rich culture, and traditional lifestyle were lost there as well. This narrative has informed the identity of modern people in the British Isles, with the Scottish, Welsh, and Irish considering themselves ethnically as well as culturally distinct from the English.
