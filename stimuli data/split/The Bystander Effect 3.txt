In recent years, efforts have been made to prevent the bystander effect, particularly in situations involving issues such as racism or child abuse. A big part of the solution seems to lie in altering social norms and standards of behavior. The forces that lead people to conform can be redirected, particularly if opinion leaders, such as popular students or celebrities, convince others that it is normal and desirable to offer help in situations where victims require aid. By developing a sense of obligation toward their community, people can overcome the forces that usually prevent them from getting involved during emergencies. If such a strategy can reduce the bystander effect, communities of all sizes might become much safer.
