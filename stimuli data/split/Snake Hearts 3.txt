According to Leinwand’s research, the chemicals in the snake’s blood cause the heart to grow in the same way that exercise usually does. She believes that if she could make a drug from these chemicals, it could cure certain heart diseases in humans. She says that more research is needed and that it will be years before a drug could be developed. However, she believes that the discovery is very exciting because it shows that the chemicals taken from one creature can affect the heart of a completely different creature.
