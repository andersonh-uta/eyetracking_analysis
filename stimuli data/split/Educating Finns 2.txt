The Finnish government requires no standard textbooks or tests. Rather, teachers are allowed to plan lessons using whatever materials they think will be best for their students. Moreover, students are not required to do much homework. In fact, the average 15-year-old studies less than 30 minutes outside of school each day. A studentâ€™s academic performance does not affect which classes or schools that student attends, and the country has almost no private schools. All these policies are the opposite of those being adopted by other countries. The aim of this system is to promote equality between students instead of focusing on high scores.
