Many large snakes eat as rarely as once every three months. When they do eat, however, they eat whole animals, such as deer or wild pigs. In order to digest these large meals, the heart and other organs inside the snake’s body suddenly grow much larger. The heart, for example, does this so that it can pump blood around the body much faster. This allows the snake to digest food more quickly. After the snake has digested the meal, the organs go back to their usual size.

One snake that does this is the Burmese python. American biologist Leslie Leinwand and her team at the University of Colorado Boulder decided to research exactly how the Burmese python manages to expand its heart so dramatically. The team found that certain chemicals in the snake’s blood cause the heart to grow. When the team added the snake’s blood to cells taken from mice’s hearts, they were surprised to find that the cells also began to grow.
