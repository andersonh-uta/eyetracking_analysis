Recent scholarship and DNA research, however, have cast doubt on this version of British history. Stephen Oppenheimer, a medical geneticist at Oxford University, found that the vast majority of native Britons, including the Scottish, Welsh, and Irish, have DNA which indicates they are in fact descended from hunter-gatherers who lived in the area of the modern-day Basque Country in Spain at the end of the Ice Age. Celtic DNA, in contrast, comprises less than 10 percent of the total genetic makeup of the male population in the British Isles. According to Oppenheimer, the original inhabitants of Britain spoke not a Celtic language, but one related to the Basque tongue, and migrated along the Atlantic coast to Britain between 15,000 and 7,500 years ago. Oppenheimer believes Celtic languages originated in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and were most likely introduced, along with agricultural practices, via subsequent Celtic migrations along the north coast of the Mediterranean and then to Britain via France about 6,000 years ago, during the Neolithic Period.
