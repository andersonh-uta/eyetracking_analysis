Title IX, a 1972 law designed to eliminate gender discrimination in education, states that any US educational institution that receives government funding must provide equal opportunities to female students. Early on, enforcement focused almost entirely on academic concerns, such as ensuring that female students had the same access to math and science programs that male students did. An unintended consequence of the law, however, was its huge impact on womenâ€™s athletics. The number of female high school athletes rose from fewer than 300,000 before the law to more than 3.2 million in 2012, and schools now provide much greater funding for female sports teams.
