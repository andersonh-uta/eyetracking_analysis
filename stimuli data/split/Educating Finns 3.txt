In order to create equal opportunities for each student, the Finnish government relies greatly on individual teachers and trusts them to make the best decisions for their classes. These teachers are, in turn, rewarded with high salaries and social status. This creates strong competition for teaching jobs, so only the most highly trained and qualified candidates can become teachers. This focus on students’ needs and high-quality teaching has led to Finland’s success. Seeing the strong results of these methods, some countries have begun to take a second look at their approach to teaching. Although education systems vary from one country to the next, all governments share the desire to provide the best education they can to their students.
