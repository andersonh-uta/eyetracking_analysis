The account of the virtual annihilation of England’s indigenous Celtic peoples by Anglo-Saxon tribes is also contradicted by both linguistic and genetic evidence. In other nations whose indigenous populations were nearly wiped out and replaced by invading peoples, such as Australia and the United States, many place-names in the language of the original inhabitants have endured to this day. But in England, as Oppenheimer points out, very few places and geographical features bear Celtic names, and the language contains just a handful of Celtic terms. Moreover, genetic studies of modern Britons show that, far from predominating the English gene pool, the Anglo-Saxons barely made a splash. In fact, even the Vikings, who are generally portrayed in the history books as raiders rather than conquerors, have a larger genetic presence in modern-day Britain than the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes do. Rather, the Anglo-Saxon invasions seem to have occurred at the elite level, displacing rulers but leaving resident populations intact. “Based on the overall genetic perspective of the British,” says Oppenheimer, “it seems that Celts, Belgians, Angles, Jutes, Saxons, Vikings and Normans were all immigrant minorities compared with the Basque pioneers.”
