It is not uncommon for victims of crimes and accidents to report that, even though there were other people nearby at the time, not a single person came to their aid. In fact, psychologists have found that the more people there are present, the less likely anyone is to come to the assistance of the person who is in trouble. This is known as the “bystander effect.” In a study of violent crimes in the United States based on data from the annual National Crime Victimization Survey, researchers found that 72 percent of the incidents had been observed by at least one witness. Because many violent crimes occur in densely populated areas, the bystander effect is often thought of as a symptom of urban lifestyles. People in modern cities tend to be less connected to their communities than small-town residents are, and city dwellers are thought to have become so fearful or uncaring that they hesitate to help strangers in need.
