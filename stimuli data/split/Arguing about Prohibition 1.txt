In 1920, the US government adopted the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, outlawing the manufacture, sale, and transport of intoxicating liquors. Many supporters of the constitutional ban, widely known as Prohibition, believed it would be permanent, but a mere 13 years later it became the first amendment ever to be repealed. In the ensuing years, Prohibition was vilified as a failed, unrealistic attempt by religious extremists to impose their values on the public. According to this view, Prohibition foundered because US citizens simply continued to drink as before, as consumption was driven underground. Meanwhile, the legitimate liquor industry was decimated, and illegal alcohol sales became a huge new source of income for organized-crime groups. Today, Prohibition has become a byword for the mistake of attempting to eliminate sin and vice through oppressive legislation, casting a shadow over later discussions of government social initiatives. Advocates of gun control are routinely compared to prohibitionists, and the tobacco industry is said to have benefited from the bad taste that Prohibition left in the publicâ€™s mouth.
