Around the time that Title IX was passed, public awareness of discrimination against female athletes was growing. Events like the famous Battle of the Sexes in 1973, in which female tennis champion Billie Jean King defeated a retired male champion named Bobby Riggs, brought greater attention to the issue. Public interest in the match was high, both because of King’s skill and because Riggs had made sexist comments such as, “I want to prove that women ... don’t belong on the same court as a man.” Changing attitudes about the role of women in sports, coupled with lawsuits against schools that failed to provide female athletes with adequate training facilities, meant US lawmakers began applying Title IX to athletics. This included the creation of rules forcing schools to provide equal opportunities for females to play sports and also provide them with the same facilities and equipment males receive.
