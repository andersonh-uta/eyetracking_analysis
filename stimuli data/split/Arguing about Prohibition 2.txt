Historians such as Jack S. Blocker Jr. of the University of Western Ontario, however, argue that common perceptions of Prohibition arise from ignorance of historical facts. Blocker holds that Prohibition functioned as a public health initiative in a period before the emergence of modern civic health policies, and he maintains that the Eighteenth Amendment was a rational move that enjoyed widespread support. While admitting that the anti-alcohol movement originated in Protestant churches, he says its proponents came to place a greater emphasis on the medical and social dangers of alcohol consumption. In this, the movement gained backing from physicians and economists worried about the dramatic rise in alcohol consumption in the early 1900s. Moreover, Blocker offers data showing that Prohibition did in fact reduce drinking, and that rates did not return to pre-Prohibition levels until the 1960s.
